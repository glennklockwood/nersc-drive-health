# NERSC SSD Smart Data

These data are the daily dumps of SMART and Intel SSD Data Center Tool (ISDCT)
outputs encoded as json and csv.  The file names are encoded such that, for
example,

    Intel_DCT_20200227.json.gz

contains the data dumped on 2020-02-27 (February 27, 2020).  The JSON and CSV
files should contain identical data; it is simply encoded in different forms.

There is no current data dictionary that describes every counter.  They contain
a mix of standard SMART counter names, counter names as described in the ISDCT
User Guide[1], and derived quantities that are generated by the pytokio ISDCT
connector[2].

Until these data are fully documented, please send any questions to Glenn K.
Lockwood.
